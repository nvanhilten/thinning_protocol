;This protocol can be used to induce thinning of lipid membranes in MD simulations. It should be called from the .mdp file, by adding the following parameters:

user1-grps               = THINNING ; index group of tail and glycerol atom
user2-grps               =
userint1                 = 1  ; module will be switched on if not 0.
userint2                 = 0
userint3                 = 0
userint4                 = 0
userreal1                = 1 ; Minimal thickness of membrane in Z dimension in nm
userreal2                = 20  ; force constant k
userreal3                = 10.0  ; Length of the thin zone in nm
userreal4                = 10.0  ; Length of the buffer zone in nm

;Please note that it is required to define a index group "THINNING" which contains the atoms on which the inward directed force will act. 
;For lipid membranes, we recommend defining the alkyl tail and glycerol atoms only.
